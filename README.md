## Goal of this project
Having worked for several years with c++98 to C++03 era code at work, it's finally around the corner that we will be able to develop our SDK using modern C++. This comes with many advantages however one very big issue is not everyone has expereience using a more modern approach and this knowledge gap can limit the quality of the prodect. In and attempt to correct this, I have revived this project in order to have some [simple guidence](Introdution.md) for those who are new to c++11's managed pointers. I have also seperated the [technical details](Implementation-Details.md) for those who may be more interested/passionate to continue learning.
